This is an Astro (https://astro.build/) project.
For scripts and node modules we use Bun (https://bun.sh/).
Project uses Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
For content we use Astro Content Layer (https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#experimentalcontentlayer)
The project deploys to Cloudflare Pages (https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
Due to being deployed to Cloudflare Pages, the project uses Cloudflare Workers (https://workers.cloudflare.com/) for the backend and must therefore not use any Node.js specific features.

Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement features I ask for.
