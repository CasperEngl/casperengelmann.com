## The story

Petsbnb is a platform where sitters and pet owners conjugate.

Allowing the sitters to better keep track and have a platform to deal with money transfers, Petsbnb streamlined the process of who does what. Both the sitter and pet owner would agree to a date and time for pickup, and Petsbnb would put that in a shared schedule.

Since there was a schedule for each sitter, it was immediately know upon browsing for sitters, who were available when.

For most pet owners, creating first contact with a sitter is a daunting task. It was important to review sitters with good ratings, reviews and their location.

People for the most part wanted a local sitter, preferably within a few kilometers. Petsbnb therefore had a map, where you could approximate each sitters location.
