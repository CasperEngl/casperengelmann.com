    Miinto is a marketplace for physical boutiques in 14 markets across Europe and China. 

    At Miinto, I'm part of the Partners & Back Office team, whose responsibility was to create the foundation for their new admin tools and management systems. My first project was Partner Management System, with a complementary component library/design system. This project is going to be the entry point for each new Partner, where their company information, market selection, contracts, etc. is stored.

    Adapt is a full-service agency, doing everything from UX, Mobile Apps to web development, both front- and backend. I was hired here because of my experience with front-end frameworks such as React and Vue. 

    Some of the clients I worked with during my time there in chronological order:
    * Sygeforsikring "danmark" - self-service platform built in React using Redux, CSS modules etc. and their new website built with Statamic, TailwindCSS and AlpineJS: sygeforsikring.dk
    * Interflora - B2B universe in Vue 3, released three months prior. This was a consulting role for a set period.
    * GSV - A heavy-machinery renter, one of Denmark's most extensive. They wanted to break into the digital world with two products named Dashboard and Kundeportal (Customer portal). The frontends were written in TypeScript with React as the framework. We also created an accompanying component library for them, which is being used across their portfolio of products.

    The company that I had together with a partner, where I worked as a consultant. During this period, I did Laravel development, implemented a new payment gateway using Stripe, and did my fair share of other odd jobs.

    Designheroes was a small agency doing development and design. My projects ranged from WordPress websites to OpenCart webshops (a reasonably old PHP framework) and Laravel development for our biggest client, both front- and back-end.

    The largest project built in Laravel was Petsbnb, a pet-sitting platform for pet owners and sitters. We handled everything from login features, calendar management, chat rooms, payments, etc.

    Web-Koncept has become one of the larger web agencies in Denmark regarding small-medium-sized businesses. At the time, I was the only coder there, which resulted in me creating in-house tools, such as Imapsync App, an email transfer app client that they still use. This is where I gained my first experience with React, which I used extensively at the time to create most of their specialized solutions.
