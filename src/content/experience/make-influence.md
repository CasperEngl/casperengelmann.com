At the moment we're building a new cross-platform app based on Vue. On the frontend I upgraded the app to Vue 3, and I'm currently working on a new design system for the app. One of my first tasks was to create a TypeScript based query builder for our GraphQL client. We use GraphQL codegen to get types for our queries and mutations. The query builder is type-safe, which means all queries, mutations and fragments will return the original type from the GraphQL schema.
