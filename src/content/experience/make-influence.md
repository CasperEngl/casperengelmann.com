We built a new cross-platform app based on Vue. On the frontend, I upgraded the app to Vue 3, and worked on a new design system for the app. One of my first tasks was to create a TypeScript-based query builder for our GraphQL client. We used GraphQL codegen to get types for our queries and mutations. The query builder was type-safe, which meant all queries, mutations, and fragments returned the original type from the GraphQL schema.
