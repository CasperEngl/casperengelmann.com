We built a new web-app based on Vue. On the frontend, I migrated the old Vue 2 architecture to Vue 3, and worked on a new design system for the app. One of my first tasks was to create a TypeScript-based query builder for our GraphQL client. We used GraphQL codegen to get types for our queries and mutations. This query builder gave us end-to-end type-safety for all our GraphQL queries, mutations, and fragments.
