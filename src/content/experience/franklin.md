At Franklin do cards made for e-commerce. We provide high spend-limits and 0.5% cashback on all card expenses. 

Since starting here I've quickly gotten up to speed since we're working with our cutting edge Next.js 15 application using React Server Components. 

We've started working on a mobile companion app that will enable our customers to use Apple Pay. They are also able to see their transactions, and will receive notifications for any transactions made to their accounts.
