Miinto is a marketplace for physical boutiques in 14 markets across Europe
and China. At Miinto, I was part of the Partners & Back Office team, whose
responsibility was to create the foundation for their new admin tools and
management systems. My first project was the Partner Management System, with
a complementary component library/design system. This project was going to
be the entry point for each new Partner, where their company information,
market selection, contracts, etc. is stored.
