Web-Koncept has become one of the larger web agencies in Denmark regarding
small-medium-sized businesses. During my time there I was the sole coder,
which led to me creating in-house tools, such as the Imapsync App, an email
transfer app client that they still use. This is where I had gained my
initial experience with React, which I utilized extensively at the time to
create most of their specialized solutions.
