Designheroes was a small agency doing development and design. My projects
ranged from WordPress websites to OpenCart webshops (a reasonably old PHP
framework) and Laravel development for our biggest client, both front- and
back-end. The largest project built in Laravel was Petsbnb, a pet-sitting
platform for pet owners and sitters. We handled everything from login
features, calendar management, chat rooms, payments, etc.
