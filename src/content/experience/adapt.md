Adapt is a full-service agency, doing everything from UX, Mobile Apps to web
development, both front- and backend. I was hired there because of my
experience with front-end frameworks such as React and Vue. Some of the
clients I worked with during my time there: _ Sygeforsikring "danmark" -
self-service platform built in React using Redux, CSS modules etc. and their
new website built with Statamic, TailwindCSS and AlpineJS: sygeforsikring.dk
_ Interflora - B2B universe as a consultant. We made with Vue 3, which was
released three months prior (EOY 2020). We used GraphQL with Apollo,
TailwindCSS, GSAP (animation), and a lot of other cool stuff. Their focus
was to create a modern, luxurious, and user-friendly experience for their
customers. \* GSV - A heavy-machinery renter, one of Denmark's most
extensive. They wanted to break into the digital world with two products
named Dashboard and Kundeportal (Customer portal). The frontends were
written in TypeScript with React as the framework. We also created an
accompanying component library for them, which is being used across their
portfolio of products.
